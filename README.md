# Maia
My personal GitHub space for R related projects and learning.
(why the name) In ancient Roman religion and myth, Maia embodied the concept of growth, Maia appears as an attribute of Vulcan, in an invocational list of male deities paired with female abstractions representing some aspect of their functionality. She was explicitly identified with Earth (Terra, the Roman counterpart of Gaia) and the Good Goddess (Bona Dea) in at least one tradition.
